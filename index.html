<h1>Hello I am Arafat Nazmul</h1>
<p>Thank You very much for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
I have done B.Sc in ETE from Daffodil International University. Now I am working as a Manager in Fiber@Home Ltd.  I have a strong interest in web designing and coding as well. The reason is I'd like to leverage my detail-oriented mind and apply the skills and knowledge that I have attained throughout my courses. I see myself as a people-oriented and over-achiever person. I demonstrated this through working in various group projects with different types of people in which I had been able to perform well.
